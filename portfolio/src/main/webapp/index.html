      <p>I'm a STEP Intern at Google this summer and student at Colorado School of Mines studying Computer Science and Data Science.</p>
      <p>This is as picture of a friend and I at the top of South Table, just next to our school's campus.</p>
      <p>I'm interested in learning more about machine translation and removing the barriers in communication for everyone, especially between different languages.</p>
